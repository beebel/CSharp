// Problem 5.**     Bits Inverter

// This problem come from C# Basics practical exam (10 April 2014 Morning). You may submit your solution here:

//
// Once Teodor played the following game: he started from a sequence of white and black balls and flipped the color
// of the 1st ball, then the color of the 4th ball, then the color of the 7th ball, etc. until the last ball.
// Flipping was performed by replacing a black b all with a white ball and vice versa. Teodor was a smart
// mathematician so he wanted to generalize his game in a formal way. This is what he invented.
//
// You are given a sequence of bytes. Consider each byte as sequences of exactly 8 bits.  You are given also a number 
// step. Write a program to invert the bits at positions: 1, 1 + step, 1 + 2*step, ... Print the output as a sequence
// of bytes.
//
// Bits in each byte are counted from the leftmost to the rightmost. Bits are numbered starting from 1.
//
// Input:
//      •	The input data should be read from the console.
//      •	The number n stays at the first line.
//      •	The number step stays at the second line.
//      •	At each of the next n lines n bytes are given, each at a separate line. 
// The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
//
// Output:
// The output should be printed on the console. Print exactly n bytes, each at a separate line and in range [0..255], 
// obtained by applying the bit inversions over the input sequence.
//
// Constraints:
//            •	The number n will be an integer number in the range [1…100].
//            •	The number step will be an integer number in the range [1…20].
//            •	The n numbers will be integers in the range [0…255].
//            •	Allowed working time for your program: 0.25 seconds.
//            •	Allowed memory: 16 MB.
//
// Examples:
//
//            Input	    Output	                        Comments
//            2         173         We have the following sequence of 16 bits (2 bytes):
//            11        71          00101101 01010111
//            45                    We invert the bits 1 and 12 (step=11). We get:
//            87                    10101101 01000111
//
//            Input	    Output	                        Comments
//            3         169         We have the following sequence of 24 bits (3 bytes):
//            5         118         00101101 01010111 11111110
//            45        246         We invert the bits 1, 6, 11, 16 and 21 (step=5). We get:
//            87                    10101001 01110110 11110110
//            254
